# Manic miner data extractor

This rather disgustingly uses an z80 asm parser (https://github.com/brianduff/z80asmparse) to pull data out of the assembly code of Manic Miner at https://github.com/SomeProgrammerGuy/Manic-Miner-Source-Code/blob/master/ManicMiner.asm

This works, but I'm going to probably switch to doing this by just pulling data directly out of the binary, since it required quite the pile of monkey grease. So just throwing this up on GitHub for posterity.
